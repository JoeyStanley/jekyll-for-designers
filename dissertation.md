# Dissertation

I'm thrilled to annouce that I defended my dissertation Wednesday, December 4, 2019 at 9:00 in the DigiLab (300 Main Library). The study is called "Vowel Dynamics of the Elsewhere Shift: A sociophonetic analysis of English in Cowlitz County, Washington."

You can download the defense draft of my dissertation [here](/downloads/191204-defense_draft.pdf). It's a relatively large file (87MB), mostly because I've got some large embedded PDFs in there and I haven't bothered to shrink them down yet.
