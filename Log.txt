Website log. Updates, notes, and todo list

12:42pm - After following the programming historian tutorial (http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), I had a simple page going. I made some changes though, and all my formatting was lost in the online version while the local version was fine. I tried uninstalling everything and googling stuff. Nothing. I decided to give up on it. Then I went to Lynda.com and found their 4 1/2 hour course (https://www.lynda.com/Jekyll-tutorials/Jekyll-Web-Designers/383124-2.html), which I went through this week. Lots of things make a lot more sense now. Plus, as a bonus, I've got a decent template to work from. Ever since then I've been making small tweaks to figure out what stuff does, and I'm trying to make it my own. As it is, the website content is all mine, and I've used my new favorite fonts, but the layout is still a blantant rip off. 

What I've done so far is changed the font from Helvetica to Avenir, and from Times New Roman to Iowan Old Style. There might be a few places where things are still weird, but the majority looks pretty good.

I also changed the social media to be my own. I wanted to add a link to academia.edu. I was able to add another line in /_includes/sidebar.html just like the other ones. I also added:

.academia {
	background: url(../images/academia.svg) no-repeat;
}

to /css/main.css. I found the .svg file on some random person's page and added that to /images. It works great, once I changed the size. I want to do the same for Google Scholar, but I can't find a .svg file of the logo. I found some other way to use social media links, but I don't like them as much (it involved adding two files to /css, and some other changes I noted in github. So for now, I've got two Academia.edu icons. I'll have to find a way to change that.

I also added justification and auto-hyphenation to all pages by adding "text-align: justify;" and "-webkit-hyphens: auto;" to the /css/main.css file. Works great. 

11:45pm - Couldn't sleep. Working on this. With slight difficulty, I got the main page to be my about page and the blog to be on its own page. I thought I could just rename the index.html page to blog.html, and rename the about.md page to index.md. At first there was some trouble with the pagination, but I found a some Jekyll help (https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/moving-the-blog-excerpts-to-another-page/1555) that said the pagination needs to be on its own page called "index.html" to work, so by renmaing it "blog.html" it wouldn't work. So I created a new folder called /blog, and put the index.html file in there. Changed the reference on the blog button to look in that folder. Everything works great. 

The next hiccup was the about.md page was in markdown, and I think the index page needs to be html. So, luckily, in the /_site folder it has everything converted to html for me automatically. So I basically copied and pasted the html version of the about.md page and changed the index.html to have that content. Sweet. Now the blog is on its own separate page, and the about me is the main page.

9:10am - I changed a few things under the hood. The "archive" page had its own separate sidebar with some duplicated social media code. Thanks to this helpful page about layouts and layout inhereitance (http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/layouts/), I created a separate /_include file for the social media, and now the sidebar calls for that, while the abbreviated sidebar just calls the social media. Cool.

10:29pm - I'm learning CSS via Jekyll. It's a thorough course but it takes a while. I'm starting to make some changes to my CSS. For now, I cleaned up how the commented portions of the CSS file looked. I also removed the underline from all external links. It's already looking better.

9:37pm - I've made the hyperlinks like the Betterick's Typography! Score!

11:31am - I just bought joeystanley.com! It's a bit more work to get it working than I expected, but I think I've got it. I followed the instructions on this site http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/. I've got it linked, but again I've lost all formatting, and the links between portions of the site isn't working. 

1:35pm - Okay, turns out the problem was the site.baseurl. It was trying to go to joeystanley.com/joeystanley/index.html. That extra "joeystanley" was throwing it off. I've removed all the "{{site.baseurl}}" tags and that seems to have done the trick. Now though when I test it offline, it's not working. The whole purpose of that flexibility was so that it would work offline and online. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do. 

1:39pm - So it looks like all offline site addreses are the same as the online ones just with "localhost:4000/" before it. I think I need to reinsert all the {{site.baseurl}} tags and replace it with "/". That sounds familiar. 

1:56pm - Okay, so that didn't work. I've got it as a working online version right nowâ€”which is more important. The site.baseurl is "/joeystanley.com", and there are no {{site.baseurl}} tags anywhere. This would be a good time to start a branch and test it out that way.  

2:12pm - Aha! I found way down in one of the comments here (https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332) that if when I serve jekyll, add the argument "--baseurl ''". It won't try to put in a baseurl in the local host. Sweet. It works great now.

4:37pm - Turns out, incoporating PDFs into the document is as straightforward as putting the file in the folder and adding a link do it.

2:33pm - I haven't done any work for a week or so. Last week I added icons to my CV page. So at the end of each line, there's a little paper or presentation icon (also movie and flyer), that takes the user to the right link. For now, the links haven't changed, but I'd like to host all my own stuff at some point.

I also incorporated Google analytics. And holy cow it's fantastic. I added a relatively small block as an include file, and then put that at the top of the index.html file. It's been about a week and it's creepy how much I can track. Pretty awesome. 


Todo list:
* Big layout changes
    * Move social media to the bottom on most pages
    * Remove the archives list from the sidebar on most pages.
* Change my main name at the top to a button that takes me to my homepage.
* Change the layout of the main page so width of the page is narrow without the need of a sidebar.
* Make the social media links dynamic.

Blog posts:
* Word: formatting, styles, etc.
* Excel
* Powerpoint: master sheets, templates
* How I did the logo hyperlinks


Debugging notes
I had a bug where the site was running even though I didn't think it was. The error code when I tried to run "jekyll serve" was "TCPServer Error: Address already in use - bind(2)". As this site says (http://www.noxidsoft.com/development/jekyll-tcpserver-error-address-already-in-use-bind-2/), try "lsof -wni tcp:4000", find the PID that is running, and then run this: "kill -9 ####". Seemed to work fine. 

Add "--baseurl ''" to get it to run locally.
