Website log. Updates, notes, and todo list

12:42pm - After following the programming historian tutorial (http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages), I had a simple page going. I made some changes though, and all my formatting was lost in the online version while the local version was fine. I tried uninstalling everything and googling stuff. Nothing. I decided to give up on it. Then I went to Lynda.com and found their 4 1/2 hour course (https://www.lynda.com/Jekyll-tutorials/Jekyll-Web-Designers/383124-2.html), which I went through this week. Lots of things make a lot more sense now. Plus, as a bonus, I've got a decent template to work from. Ever since then I've been making small tweaks to figure out what stuff does, and I'm trying to make it my own. As it is, the website content is all mine, and I've used my new favorite fonts, but the layout is still a blantant rip off. 

What I've done so far is changed the font from Helvetica to Avenir, and from Times New Roman to Iowan Old Style. There might be a few places where things are still weird, but the majority looks pretty good.

I also changed the social media to be my own. I wanted to add a link to academia.edu. I was able to add another line in /_includes/sidebar.html just like the other ones. I also added:

.academia {
	background: url(../images/academia.svg) no-repeat;
}

to /css/main.css. I found the .svg file on some random person's page and added that to /images. It works great, once I changed the size. I want to do the same for Google Scholar, but I can't find a .svg file of the logo. I found some other way to use social media links, but I don't like them as much (it involved adding two files to /css, and some other changes I noted in github. So for now, I've got two Academia.edu icons. I'll have to find a way to change that.

I also added justification and auto-hyphenation to all pages by adding "text-align: justify;" and "-webkit-hyphens: auto;" to the /css/main.css file. Works great. 

11:45pm - Couldn't sleep. Working on this. With slight difficulty, I got the main page to be my about page and the blog to be on its own page. I thought I could just rename the index.html page to blog.html, and rename the about.md page to index.md. At first there was some trouble with the pagination, but I found a some Jekyll help (https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/moving-the-blog-excerpts-to-another-page/1555) that said the pagination needs to be on its own page called "index.html" to work, so by renmaing it "blog.html" it wouldn't work. So I created a new folder called /blog, and put the index.html file in there. Changed the reference on the blog button to look in that folder. Everything works great. 

The next hiccup was the about.md page was in markdown, and I think the index page needs to be html. So, luckily, in the /_site folder it has everything converted to html for me automatically. So I basically copied and pasted the html version of the about.md page and changed the index.html to have that content. Sweet. Now the blog is on its own separate page, and the about me is the main page.

9:10am - I changed a few things under the hood. The "archive" page had its own separate sidebar with some duplicated social media code. Thanks to this helpful page about layouts and layout inhereitance (http://jekyll.tips/jekyll-casts/layouts/), I created a separate /_include file for the social media, and now the sidebar calls for that, while the abbreviated sidebar just calls the social media. Cool.

10:29pm - I'm learning CSS via Jekyll. It's a thorough course but it takes a while. I'm starting to make some changes to my CSS. For now, I cleaned up how the commented portions of the CSS file looked. I also removed the underline from all external links. It's already looking better.

9:37pm - I've made the hyperlinks like the Betterick's Typography! Score!

11:31am - I just bought joeystanley.com! It's a bit more work to get it working than I expected, but I think I've got it. I followed the instructions on this site http://www.curtismlarson.com/blog/2015/04/12/github-pages-google-domains/. I've got it linked, but again I've lost all formatting, and the links between portions of the site isn't working. 

1:35pm - Okay, turns out the problem was the site.baseurl. It was trying to go to joeystanley.com/joeystanley/index.html. That extra "joeystanley" was throwing it off. I've removed all the "{{site.baseurl}}" tags and that seems to have done the trick. Now though when I test it offline, it's not working. The whole purpose of that flexibility was so that it would work offline and online. So I'm not sure what I'm going to do. 

1:39pm - So it looks like all offline site addreses are the same as the online ones just with "localhost:4000/" before it. I think I need to reinsert all the {{site.baseurl}} tags and replace it with "/". That sounds familiar. 

1:56pm - Okay, so that didn't work. I've got it as a working online version right nowâ€”which is more important. The site.baseurl is "/joeystanley.com", and there are no {{site.baseurl}} tags anywhere. This would be a good time to start a branch and test it out that way.  

2:12pm - Aha! I found way down in one of the comments here (https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/332) that if when I serve jekyll, add the argument "--baseurl ''". It won't try to put in a baseurl in the local host. Sweet. It works great now.

4:37pm - Turns out, incoporating PDFs into the document is as straightforward as putting the file in the folder and adding a link do it.

2:33pm - I haven't done any work for a week or so. Last week I added icons to my CV page. So at the end of each line, there's a little paper or presentation icon (also movie and flyer), that takes the user to the right link. For now, the links haven't changed, but I'd like to host all my own stuff at some point.

I also incorporated Google analytics. And holy cow it's fantastic. I added a relatively small block as an include file, and then put that at the top of the index.html file. It's been about a week and it's creepy how much I can track. Pretty awesome.

8:18pm - I did a lot today. I added a blog post about the Brand Yourself workshop, as well as a short one on DiVar. Since the number of images I have is getting unweildy, I made subdirectories. I removed the "this is a copy" disclaimer at the top. Changed some of the tags. Uploaded my slides.

12:56am - Per Brad Moser's suggestion, I moved the social media to the top. I removed it from the aside, made the header a 1x2 table, and put the liquid syntax there. I changed the look slightly, including right aligning the text. I also removed any relevant CSS code, and changed others so that it would work. 

12:59am - Removed the Lynda.com text from the post footer. 

2:06am - I've removed the sidebar, but I'm not satisfied with the way it looks. Also, I've messed up the formatting on the Posts page. But I'm too tired to figure out what the problem is. I want to center the top buttons but can't figure out the CSS that targets it. I almost want to just start from scratch so I know what's going on.

9:32am - Moved the Resources page to Dumper. Don't need it for now.


Monday, December 5, 2016
8:17pm - I tried to do my Guarani thing and it messed a lot of stuff up. I think what happened is I installed a bunch of newer versions of gems, but my code requires the older versions. What I have to do now is use "bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''" now when I run it. The 'bundle exec' part runs versions required for the current file. I guess that's fine. Slightly more typing for me.

2:09pm - So I have some layout changes that I haven't committed yet. I don't like the sidebar, but I do like the layout of having a sidebar. I'll go ahead and commit for now. Now that I've done the Guarani site, I feel a little bit better about creating something from scratch. I'd like to make some blog posts for now, but before ADS I should create the page from scratch. I don't like the archives page, and some things were messed up with recent changes. 

4:21pm - Added the Guarani post. 

5:36pm - Added Google Custom Search Engine code as an include file. Not included yet, because I can't figure out where. Perhaps on the archives page. But! The weird formatting with the archives page miraculously got fixed!

9:43pm - I want to change how the hyperlinks are working, but I spent a lot of time and ended up with nothing that worked out well. Shoot.

8:58pm - I've learned how to make redirects! First, from this site (https://help.github.com/articles/redirects-on-github-pages/) I saw that I needed to add "- jekyll-redirect-from" to my gems. But to get that to work, I needed to install that gem with this line in the command line ("gem install jekyll-redirect-from", from this site: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from). Then I just put the redirect at the top of my page and now it works great. Now I can put perminant links to things, and still move things around. Sweet. I created a new folder called "pages" and put the files there. Once I remove them from the main page though there will be no way to get back to them. I need to find a way to do that. 

9:05pm - Okay, problem. It works locally, but when I run it live, it redirects to joeystanley.com/joeystanley.com/pages/excel. I think because it has to do with the base url stuff. I wonder if I have to put in all the liquid formatting again to get all that to work...

9:36pm - Okay, so I changed the baseurl to "" and added a siteurl as "joeystanley.com". That seems to work. Also, now I don't need to add the baseurl '' to the jeykll call anymore.

8:47pm - I've spent some time on the fromScratch version of the website. I did that last Sunday and it looks really good. I've got a nice header at the top with better navigation buttons. My CV page is clean. I've got an aside going that looks pretty good (though I'm working on it still). I've created a "Research" page modeled after the DigiLab page, so I've got some picture placeholders on the side. It's looking good. I need to get the blog up next, and after copying and pasting the code, the pagination thing isn't quite working out, so I'll need to figure out why. 


Sunday, February 19, 2017
7:12am - Oh. Never mind. I removed all the other blog posts when I made this new folder. I just copied them over and now they look fine. Now I just need to mess with the CSS to make the main page look good. The blogs themselves look fine, which is good. 

9:28pm - Worked on the main blog page. Looks pretty good. I've set the maximum number of blog posts to display as 50 because I didn't like not seeing them all at once. If I ever get to that many, I can work on some other management system but for now I'll leave it. The code is there still so at 51 things will spill over into other pages, but it's a little buggy. 


Monday, February 20, 2017
10:24pm - The blog portion is done. I got the footer to look good and it works propertly. I also got the tags to appear on the side of each one. Next step: figure out why when I click on tags, I get just a blank page. Then I just need to add a "Teaching" page, then a "Resources" page, and then figure out the main sidebar and get that to look good. Then it'll be ready to go live.


Wednesday, Febraury 22, 2017
9:32pm - I got the tags done. I wanted them to expand on the sidebar itself. No go. That requires some Java. I then wanted a separate page for each tag, with blog excerpts, but no go. Instead, I modified the archives page and made it its own page. Right now it's only accessible if you click on a tag. I might but a link at the bottom of the tags sidebar, but I don't know.

10:46pm - I've got a blog excerpt from my most recent blog post. Score! I also wrote a new introduction. And I put some "under construction" pages for the Teaching and Resources tabs. This is looking pretty good. I would launch it and make it live now, but I need to finish learning about CSS web design and responsive design first. There are a few layout bugs still, but this is starting to look pretty good.


Sunday, February 26, 2017
9:14pm - The site has been launched! I'm still working through making the site look good across devices and browsers, but I think it's ready to launch for now. Looks good and the transition was easy. What I want to do now is add to my "Resources" tab now that it's there. 

10:48pm - I started the resources tab. I wrote a little blurb about the Excel workshop. I didn't want to make a whole separate page because I've already done that as a blog post. So I removed the temporary page I did and redirected everything, including the link in "resources", to the blog post. Works great. 


Monday, March 19, 2017
9:30pm - I've fallen a little behind in adding my PDFs and slideshows to my CV. Make sure all that is up there and that I have permissions to add it.



Blog posts:
* Word: formatting, styles, etc.
* Powerpoint: master sheets, templates
* How I did the logo hyperlinks
* Google Analytics
    * Include how to filter out myself (https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034823)
* Make a blog post about BubblePlots. JMP says that Hans Rosling pioneered them, which I didn't know. http://www.jmp.com/support/help/Bubble_Plots.shtml#222083
* Make a blog post about my formatting branding. Include ggplot2 and how I get the graphics and colors to match.
* Make a mega post about what R packages I use and what functions within them. It might be good to have a post organized by package, and other one organized by purpose. Basically, I'd have to go through the books I've used and summarize them. Could potentially take a long time but might be useful at least for me to keep track of what I use. 


Debugging notes
I had a bug where the site was running even though I didn't think it was. The error code when I tried to run "jekyll serve" was "TCPServer Error: Address already in use - bind(2)". As this site says (http://www.noxidsoft.com/development/jekyll-tcpserver-error-address-already-in-use-bind-2/), try "lsof -wni tcp:4000", find the PID that is running, and then run this: "kill -9 ####". Seemed to work fine. 

Add "--baseurl ''" to get it to run locally. (bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl '')

Now, I don't need to do that. All I need is "bundle exec jekyll serve".
