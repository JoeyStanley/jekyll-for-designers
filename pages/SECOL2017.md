I was unable to attend this year, but my colleages presented two papers I was a part of at the 84th Southeastern Conference on Linguistics in Charelston, South Carolina.

The first presentation was with Bill Kretzschmar and Katie Kuiper and was called "Automated Large-Scale Phonetic Analysis: DASS" wherein we introduce the project I am involved in and that Kretzschmar and Peggy Renwick are PIs of. A PDF of the slide show is are available <a href="/downloads/170310-SECOL84a-slides.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

The second was with Rachel Olsen, Mike Olsen, and Peggy Renwick and was called "Transcribing the Digital Archive of Southern Speech: Methods and Preliminary Analysis" wherein we talked about the nuts and bolts of how to get a project of this size running. A PDF of the slide show is are available <a href="/downloads/170310-SECOL84b-slides.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
