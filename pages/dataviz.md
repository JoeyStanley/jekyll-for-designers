# Data Visualization Workshops

I will be leading a series of two workshops on data visualization during Fall 2019. This page will house the handouts and all materials for those workshops.

Note: Both workshops will be held at 3:35pm at the DigiLab (300 Main Library) 

<br/>

## *Fidelity, integrity, and sophistication: Edward Tufte’s principles of data visualization*

*October 16, 2019*---In this workshop, I introduce a few key concepts from Edward Tufte's book, *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information* such as graphical integrity, proportional ink, data-ink ratio, removing redundant material, and general graphical sophistication. Basically, the workshop could be thought of as, "How not to make awful plots."

## [*Send the right message: The dos and don’ts of COLOR in data visualization*](/downloads/191023-color.pdf)

*October 23, 2019*---Meagan Duever, GIS Librarian at UGA will help me lead this workshop. We talk about general principles of color in data visualization, introduce a whole bunch of nice color palattes, and demonstrate how to customize your colors in ArcMap, QGIS, Excel, and R.
