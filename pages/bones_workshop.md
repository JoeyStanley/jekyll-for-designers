# Workshop

This page contains the handouts for the workshop for the "Research Experience for Undergraduates" site program. I am told the students spent three weeks collecting osteological data from skeletons at the 7-5th c. BCE Greek colony of Himera. The workshop will take place June 21, 2018 in the DigiLab.

## Part 1: Intro to R
*9:00–9:45*

In this first part, we'll do an introduction to R. We'll talk about what R is, look at the differences between R and RStudio, and then get our hands dirty with actual R code. We'll see how to do some of the basics, get your data into R, and how to work with it. Most importantly, we'll see how to get help. In theory, this should go from 9:00 to 9:45.

## Part 2: Data Visualization
*9:45–10:30*

In this second portion of the workshop, we'll look at the `ggplot` package and see how to make some simple visualizations in R. We'll see how to make scatter plots, bar plots, and boxplots, as well as some variations on each.

## Part 3: Statistical Tests
*10:30–11:00*

This last part of the workshop is specifically devoted to how to run some statistics on your data. We'll look at samples of the kind of data you have and see how to run tests like the *t*-test, the Mann-Whitney test, and the Kruskall-Wallis test. Moving over to categorical data, we'll see how to do chi-squared tests and Fisher's exact test. Finally, we'll see how to do Principal Components Analysis. At every step of the way, there will be little interjections on best practices and how to make useful visualizations to help you with these.

## Part 4: Work on your own
*11:00–12:00*

Assuming I don't go over time, my goal is to have an hour devoted to you working on your own data (from 11:00 until noon). I'll wander around and help with specific questions when needed. This cushion is also there in case I go long, which I most likely will do…
