# Praat Workshops

Lisa Lipani and I will be hosting a series of four workshops on Praat and Praat scripting during Fall 2019. This page will house the handouts and all materials for those workshops.

Note: All workshops will be held at 3:35pm at the DigiLab (300 Main Library) 

<br/>

## *Praat Basics: Introduction to the software*

*September 11, 2019*---In this workshop, Joey will introduce the software Praat, and will how how to install the software, record audio, save audio, and do a manual transcription. It will also briefly discuss the important steps you need to take to prep your data *before* using Praat. (For former students of mine, this workshop will overlap with [this homework assignment](/downloads/190523-Praat_tutorial.pdf).)

<br/>

## *Praat Scripting Basics: Loops, I/O, and TextGrids*

*September 18, 2019*---With some basic understanding of the software, Lisa will lead the workshop on the fundamentals of Praat scripting: object management, looping through a TextGrid, and how to get your data in and out of a Praat script.

<br/>

## *Automatic Formant Extraction (and other acoustic measures) in Praat*

*October 2, 2019*---In this workshop, you'll learn, from start to finish, how to write a Praat script that will automatically extract formant measurements and a other acoustic measurements from your audio and transcription. There will be quite a bit of overlap with [this blog post](/blog/a-tutorial-on-extracting-formants-in-praat), only you will get more detail with an in-person guide.

<br/>

## *Automatic Measurement of VOT in Praat*

*November 6, 2019*---In case you're more interested in consonants, Lisa will lead the final workshop on how to extract VOT (voice onset time) as well as show how to write a semi-automated script to help you hand-check your data.
