There's a trend on linguistics Twitter right now, where people are sharing the ages that they started studying/learning whatever languages they know. As I thought about the ones I know, I realized that there's a story behind each one, so I figured it'd make for a potentially interesting blog post. 

## English

My first and, for a long time, only language. Read more about my idiolect [here](/idiolect.md).

## (Modern) Greek

In fourth grade, I was in a "gifted" program or whatever and we had a unit on Greek. I remember nothing.  

## Swahili

In fifth grade, that same gifted program had a Swahili unit. Literally the only think I remember is "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes", which is *Kichwa, mabega, magoti na migu*. Google Translate has *toes* as *vidole*, so I don't know what *migu* is. 

Unrelated to that, early in grad school, probably around summer 2015 or so, I thought I'd audit Swahili. I sat in on one class and decided I probably didn't have the time to commit.

## Portuguese

When I was 19, I started my two-year stint as a Mormon missionary in Brazil. I took some private lessons for a couple months summer 2007 from A Brazilian woman in my congregation. When I moved there, I was put into an intensive language training course, which was about 9 weeks, after which I was fully immersed. 

It took a while for me to attain fluency, but I made it there eventually. I made a *ton* of flashcards and learned lots of words. People would joke that if anyone needed to teach a lawyer, they'd have to call me because I'm the only one that has the vocabulary. My pronunciation wasn't bad either: I could convince people that I was from Brazil---granted, I told them I was from Amapá, a remote, rural state way up in the Amazon. No one knew anyone from there, so they were often like, "Oh, so that's what the accent sounds like." About a month before I was finished, I bought a big ol' grammar book, one that was intended for Brazilian university students studying Portuguese, and read the whole thing. Very interesting.

Since being back in the US, I've had relatively little opportunity to use my Portuguese. I took a grammar course and a lit course as an undergrad. In grad school, I attended a conversation group. I also was briefly part of a research team that analyzed monkey vocalizations and I had one heck of a time trying to explain statistics in Portuguese. Mormon missionaries don't exactly need that kind of vocabulary, so that was a lot of new words. 

How is my Portuguese now? Pretty rusty. Probably not terrible and I could survive. I've forgotten a lot of the nuance on how to say certain things. I listen to podcasts occasionally and I don't understand everything, which is a little disheartening. But, again, as a missionary there are a *lot* of semantic domains that you don't ever need to talk about, so it makes sense. Maybe I just need to start busting out the vocab cards again.

## Guarani

After living in Brazil for about nine months, I was transferred to Campo Grande where I encountered Guarani for the first time. I thought it was interesting and I thought I'd try to learn it. A friend had what was basically a "teach yourself Guarani" book that was written in Spanish---so I had to quickly figure out a bit of basic Spanish to read it. My dad also sent me a copy of the Book of Mormon in Guarani and said, "Have fun!" So over the next few months, here and there, I learned a bit of grammar and vocabulary. This was my first time looking at a non-Indo-European language and it was fascinating to me. By the end of my time in Brazil, I had actually figured out quite a bit of grammar.

When I got back to BYU, I found some old books on Guarani and used them to learn more of the grammar I hadn't figured out via translation. 

## Kichwa

After my intro to linguistics course, I went on a language documentation study abroad to Amazonian Ecuador. There, I started to learn Ecuadorian (Lowland, Pastaza, etc) Kichwa. That was summer of 2011. I never really got to the point of being fluent, but I had two semesters' worth of coursework done, so I had, at one point, a bit of vocabulary and a decent grasp of lots of basic grammar. Nowadays, I remember virtually nothing, but when I see my colleague Janis Nuckolls talk about her research, some things come back.

## Spanish

At some point while in Brazil, I started to study Spanish on my own. I had to know something because that Guarani book I had was written in Spanish. I've never taken formal classes though, so I don't know much. Knowing Portuguese is helpful and I tell people that my Spanish is basically Portuguese with a Spanish accent. I also have a really hard time understanding spoken Spanish, though when I was in Ecuador, I noticed that Ecuadorian Spanish was much easier. My one success story was the one time I was in Sunday School while in Ecuador and the teacher called on me to answer a question, and not only did I understand the question, but I also produced a coherent answer.

## Mandarin

While in Ecuador, a fellow study abroader spoke Chinese. I had two roommates who spoke Chinese at the time. And I was interested in learning more about tone. So I signed up for Mandarin and ended up taking two semesters of it. I enjoyed it. Except for the writing. I don't think we advanced very far at all because everything we learned to say we had to be able to read and write too, and learning characters was a slow process. I think by the end, I knew just shy of 500 characters. What little grammar I knew though I felt pretty comfortable. Literally the only thing I remember today is 我有兩個會說中文的室友, "I have two roommates who can speak Chinese." Except I had to look up the characters on Google Translate. Knowing Pinyin at least has been helpful for reading Chinese names.

## Haitian Creole

## K'iche'

I sat in 

## Ukrainian


I've heard people say that the more languages you know, the harder it is to define *fluent*.
