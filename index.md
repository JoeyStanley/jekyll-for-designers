About me
========

I’m an Assistant Professor in [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.byu.edu) at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu), doing a lot of sociophonetics and dialectology while finding new statistical and computational methods to help me in my research. In May 2020, I received my Ph.D in linguistics from the [Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.uga.edu) at the [University of Georgia](https://www.uga.edu). 

My primary area of research is on English in the western United States. My [dissertation](/blog/dissertation) focused on English in Cowlitz County, Washington and the spread of the vowel patterns known to occur in other parts of the West. Because I mostly focus on vowels, I've had to learn the skills required to analyze them: Praat scripting, data visualization, and statistical methods. I also lean towards the variationist sociolinguistic perspective in data collection and analysis. 

As a graduate student, I was involved with [Bill Kretzschmar](https://www.english.uga.edu/directory/495/detail) and [Peggy Renwick](https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about) and the other student workers at the [Linguistic Atlas Project](http://www.lap.uga.edu/) where my job was to act as the middleman between transcriptions and formant measurements. I wrote and maintained many of the Praat, R, and Perl scripts we used in the lab, and managed the various forced aligners and automatic formant extractors we worked with. I also created and manage the the [*Gazetteer of Southern Vowels*](http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/).

I was also a research assistant in the [DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu) in UGA's main library where I gave workshops and seminars on how to use computers in humanities research. I offered workshops on [R](pages/r-workshops), [data visualization](pages/dataviz), [Praat scripting](pages/praat-workshops), and about how grad students can get themselves more googleable. I also worked with students and faculty one-on-one during my Digital Humanities office hours.

<!--In the past I have done research on language change in real time, morphology in Quechua and Guarani, forms of address among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, language documentation, and agent-based simulations of language change. Before switching to linguistics, I was a music performance major (on trombone believe it or not!) and you might still catch me playing some Shostakovich or Rachmaninoff on piano.  -->

I publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey. <!-- Recent non-linguistics books I've read were on ghost towns, typography, the Strauss–Howe generational theory, and very specific topics under the broad umbrella of "civil engineering."--> I live in Spanish Fork with my wife (Kelly) and kids (Lena and Walter). On the weekends I enjoy artisan breadmaking.
