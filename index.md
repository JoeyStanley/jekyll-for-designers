About me
========

I’m a doctoral candidate in linguistics at the University of Georgia, doing a lot of sociophonetics and dialectology while finding new statistical and computational methods to help me in my research. Starting in June 2020, I will be an Assistant Professor in the Department of Linguistics at Brigham Young University!

My primary area of research is on English in the western United States. My [dissertation](/blog/dissertation) focuses on English in Cowlitz County, Washington and the spread of the vowel patterns known to occur in other parts of the West. Because I mostly focus on vowels, I've had to learn the skills required to analyze them: Praat scripting, forced alignment, and statistical methods. I also lean towards the variationist sociolinguistic perspective in data collection and analysis. 

I'm actively involved with <a href="https://www.english.uga.edu/directory/495/detail">Bill Kretzschmar</a> and <a href="https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about" title="Peggy Renwick">Peggy Renwick</a> and the other student workers at the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/" title="Linguist Atlas Project">Linguistic Atlas Project</a> where my job is to act as the middleman between transcriptions and formant measurements. I write and maintain many of the Praat, R, and Perl scripts we use in the lab, and manage the various forced aligners and automatic formant extractors we work with. I also created and manage the project's website, the [*Gazetteer of Southern Vowels*](http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/).

I also am a research assistant in the [DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu) in UGA's main library where I give workshops and seminars on how to use computers in humanities research. In the past, I've offered workshops on [R](pages/r-workshops), [data visualization](pages/dataviz), [Praat scripting](pages/praat-workshops), and about how grad students can get themselves more googleable. I've also worked with students and faculty one-on-one during my Digital Humanities office hours.

<!--In the past I have done research on language change in real time, morphology in Quechua and Guarani, forms of address among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, language documentation, and agent-based simulations of language change. Before switching to linguistics, I was a music performance major (on trombone believe it or not!) and you might still catch me playing some Shostakovich or Rachmaninoff on piano.  -->

I publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey. <!-- Recent non-linguistics books I've read were on ghost towns, typography, the Strauss–Howe generational theory, and very specific topics under the broad umbrella of "civil engineering."--> I live in Athens with my family and enjoy artisan breadmaking on the weekends.
