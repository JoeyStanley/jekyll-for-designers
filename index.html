            <h2>About me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Hey. I’m Joey. I’m a third-year lingusitics grad student at the University of Georgia, doing a lot of sociolinguistics and phonetics while finding new statistical and computational methods to help me in my research.</p>
        <p>I work at with the <a href="http://lap.uga.edu/" title="Linguist Atlas Project">Linguistic Atlas Project</a>, where I write and maintain most of the Praat scripts, under the direction of Drs. <a href="https://www.english.uga.edu/directory/495/detail">Bill Kretzschmar</a> and <a href="https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about" title="Peggy Renwick">Peggy Renwick</a>. I also work with the UGA <a href="https://digi.uga.edu" title="DigiLab main page">DigiLab</a> where I give seminars and workshops on how to help students and faculty use computers effectively in their humanities research. On top of that, I work with Dr. Renwick in developing teaching materals for her <em>Quantitative Methods in Linguistics</em> course here at UGA.</p>
        <p>My own research is currently on vowels in the western United States. Dr. Renwick presented a poster she and I worked on involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/26986601/Phonetic_Shift_ɔr_Phonemic_Change_American_English_mergers_over_40_years">Stanley &amp; Renwick 2016</a>), and currently, with data from <a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/">Ben Tucker</a> at the University of Alberta, we are digging a little deeper into that. I’ve also got a big project in the works on English in the Pacific Northwest. I conducted 54 sociolinguistic interviews this summer in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cowlitz+County,+WA/@46.1203776,-123.0089545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549415fb272f02b1:0x925df86af59a9d68!8m2!3d46.1746472!4d-122.7746902" title="Cowlitz County, Washington">Cowlitz County, Washington</a> and I’ve only scratched the surface in analyzing that data. (See my upcoming presentation at the <a href="http://www.americandialect.org/american-dialect-society-2017-annual-meeting-schedule">2017 Annual Meeting of the America Dialect Society</a> for my first results!) I also have access to the original handwritten data from the <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Linguistic+Atlas+of+the+Pacific+Northwest%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C11&amp;as_sdtp=">Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest</a></em>—which, as far as I know, haven’t seen the light of day for several decades—and I’m hoping to incorporate that into my work.</p>
        <p>I publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey.</p>
