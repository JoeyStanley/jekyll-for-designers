Datasets
========

Below you will find some datasets I use for various workshops. They are all either my own data (so like, based on my own voice) or are publically available.

## [Stranger Things](/data/stranger.csv)

A small dataset with basic information about each episode of *Stranger Things*. I use this in my most recent ggplot2 workshops. I IMDb's [data download page](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) to actually get it, and did a little bit of prep work to make it ready for the workshop.
