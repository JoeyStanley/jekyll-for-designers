Datasets
========

Below you will find some datasets I use for various workshops. They are all either my own data (so like, based on my voice or behavior) or are publically available.

## Cereal ([.csv](/data/cereal.csv) or [.txt](/data/cereal.txt).)

A dataset of containing a bunch of information about 80 different kinds of breakfast cereal. I use this in some of my ggplot2 workshops. I got the dataset from the the one that [Chris Crawford](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford) at [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals) has made available but I've removed some of the columns to make it more manageable for a workshop. In his words, "If you like to eat cereal, do yourself a favor and avoid this dataset at all costs. After seeing these data it will never be the same for me to eat Fruity Pebbles again."

## [McDonald's Menu Items](/data/menu.csv)

A dataset of each menu item at McDonald's. I use this in some of my ggplot2 workshops. The full dataset, with many more columns than what I have provided here, is available on [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/mcdonalds/nutrition-facts), which was ultimately scraped from the McDonald's website. I've trimmed it down a little bit for the purposes of the workshop.

## Olympic Games ([athletes](/data/athletes.csv), [events](/data/events.csv), [years](/data/years.csv))

This is data about the atheletes, events, from the Olympic games. I use this in my tidyverse workshops to illustrate joining different datasetes. 

## [Snoozing](/data/snoozing.xlsx)

This is data about when I've woken up every morning for about two years. Just information I downloaded from my iPhone's Health app. I use this in some Tidyverse workshops for simple illustrations of reading in an excel file and doing some data manipulation and joining. 

## [Stranger Things](/data/stranger.csv)

A small dataset with basic information about each episode of *Stranger Things*. I use this in my most recent ggplot2 workshops. I went to IMDb's [data download page](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/) to actually get it, and did a little bit of prep work to make it ready for the workshop.

## Vowels ([tall](/data/vowels_tall.csv) and [wide](/data/vowels_wide.csv))

Two datasets of acoustic measurements from my own speech. They contain identical information, but one is "tall" and the other is "wide." They're used in my first Tidyverse workshop. The same data is also used in some of my vowel tutorials.
