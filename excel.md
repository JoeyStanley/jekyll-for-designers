Thanks for coming to the workshop. Feel free to download the following: 

1) The 45-page <a href="/downloads/170127-Excel.pdf" title="download Excel handout">handout</a> as a PDF.

2) The three datasets I used: the vowels for one speaker, the vowels subset of all speakers, and Cowlitz County census data. The vowels data comes from the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States.

You can also visit the accompanying blog post on the <a href="https://digi.uga.edu/news/be-a-data-magician/" title="DigiLab blog post">DigiLab website</a>.
