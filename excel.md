Thanks for coming to the workshop. Feel free to download the following: 

1) The 45-page <a href="/downloads/170127-Excel.pdf" title="download Excel handout">handout</a> as a PDF.

2) The three datasets I used: the vowels for [one speaker](http://digi.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/vowels_oneSpeaker.xlsx), the vowels subset of [all speakers](http://digi.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/vowels_1.xlsx), and Cowlitz County [census data](http://digi.uga.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/cowlitzData.xlsx). The vowels data comes from the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States.
