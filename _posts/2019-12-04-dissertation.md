I'm happy to report that I successfully defended my dissertation today! The defense was held in the DigiLab (300 Main Library). The study itself is called "Vowel Dynamics of the Elsewhere Shift: A sociophonetic analysis of English in Cowlitz County, Washington."

You can download it [here](/downloads/200417-dissertation_submitted.pdf). That's the version that was submitted to the grad school, so it's the official one. I'll probably make a few tweaks here and there to the visuals and the way references are formatted in the future, but I'll try to keep the page numbers the same.
