I'm happy to report that I successfully defended my dissertation today! The defense was held in the DigiLab (300 Main Library). The study itself is called "Vowel Dynamics of the Elsewhere Shift: A sociophonetic analysis of English in Cowlitz County, Washington."

When I'm all finished and submitted, this page will become the homepage of my dissertation. I hope to add a summary, some illustrative figures, and comments on the formatting. For now, I'll focus on getting revisions done. 

For now, you can download the defense draft of my dissertation [here](/downloads/191204-defense_draft.pdf). It's a relatively large file (87MB), mostly because I've got some large embedded PDFs in there and I haven't bothered to shrink them down yet.
