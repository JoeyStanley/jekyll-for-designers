Between April and July, I distributed a survey to people in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah, asking them to record themselves reading a bunch of words and answering some open-ended questions about language. The results from this study will be published in more academic venues, but for now I wanted to explain in non-academic terms what the (basic) results are from that study.

## Overview of the study

I set up a study to analyze pronunciation in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and Utah. Of the four states, Utah has gotten by far the most amount of attention by linguists. There have been very occasional occasional studies on word choice and grammar in the other states over the last century of research, but the number of studies on actual pronunciation can be counted on one hand: one in Idaho, two in Montana, and zero in Wyoming. So, this study aims to give a basic first-look at what's going on.

I decided to have people record audio from their own devices. Yes, this is going to make some things inconsistent across recordings because people will use different microphones. Again, this is a first pass at what's going on. Besides, it's a lot easier (and more covid-friendly) to collect data remotely than it is to travel to people in-person.

What do I look for? Since I'm going in more or less blind, I decided to focus my study around things known to be interesting in Utah. I know it's not the best method since there's no reason to expect Utah English pronunciation to be found in other states. But again, I'm going in blind, and I had to start somewhere. I'll list those linguistic variables below.

As a way to collect additional data, I decided to have people answer some open-ended questions as well. For example, I asked people whether they think their state has an accent. I could have had them type the response, but I think the responses were more detailed and genuine when spoken rather than typed out. The side benefit of this is I get a chance to hear how people talk when they're not reading a rigid list of words. 

To distribute the survey, I went to Reddit. I found every subreddit dedicated to a city, region, or university based in the four states. For example, I posted in bigger ones like r/Wyoming, but also smaller ones like r/Butte, r/NorthIdaho, and r/WeberState. I posted in around 60 subreddits over the course of a couple months. Around 350 people completed the survey. 

From there, I analyzed the data using pretty typical techniques for current sociolinguistic work. For some things (like consonants), I just listened and transcribed what I heard. For other things (like vowels), I extract acoustic measurements from the audio and some statistics and stuff to crunch the numbers. 

Hopefully that gives you an decent big-picture view of what's going on with this study.


## Linguistic Variables

In the survey, I asked people to read aloud a list of 200 words. Each of those words was specifically targetting one more of the following linguistic variables. I'll briefly mention them here as an overview, but I'll give more detail in the sections below.

TODO: add linguistic variables



## What results do I have yet?

I collected far more data than I ever could have hoped for! That's good news for me and my research agenda. The bad news is it's going to take some time to get all the results. Here are some of the things I've looked at (briefly) so far. 

* What are the ways that people pronounce the linguistic variables listed above?
* What differences are there across the four states?

<br/>
Of course there are many, many other questions I can of this data that I just haven't gotten to yet. Here are a few:

* How are the pronunciation differences listed above different across genders, ethnicities, ages, or other demographic info? 
* Are there regional differences within states? Many of you said that you think so, and I think you're probably right. But I don't have quite enough data to say for sure, and I haven't done that analysis yet. 
* Do people from urban areas sound different from people in rural areas? Again, lots of you said there is. I just haven't done the actual linguistic analysis to support this. You may have remembered though that I asked whether you wanted to live in an urban or rual place. I think that *aspiration* may have a bigger effect than the actual place you grew up. We'll see. 
* Do Mormons have an accent? Is that distinct from non-practicing Mormons, ex-Mormons, and non-members? I don't know. I asked about it and I have data on people's affiliation with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I suspect that I'll find very slight differences, but we'll see.
* If people said they had some connection to the Church, I asked some additional questions about "Relief Society Voice," "Missionary Voice," and "General Authorty Voice." I got some great comments. So the question is, are those real? I won't be able to answer this question directly with this data, but I certainly have a lot of comments to draw from when designing my next study!

<br/>
So, I apoligize if the question you want me to ansewr hasn't been addressed. Hopefully I can get to some of these soon!

Without futher ado, let's get into the results!

## Mountain

When asked whether your state has an accent, by far the most common thing people mentioned was how people say the word *mountain* and similar words *fountain*, *gluten*, *satin*, etc. Over half the Utahs mentioned this, and a handful of people in other states did too. 

So how *do* people say the word *mountain*? 

Despite what most people think, the most common way of saying this word across North American English is like this:

INSERT AUDIO HERE

This has what's called a "glottal stop", which is that sort of catch in the back of your throat, instead of a typical *t* sound that you might get in a word like *top*. After that glottal stop, people go straight into the *n* sound. So it's "<span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span>". (I'm going to color code it to visually help you keep track of the variants I discuss here.)There is no vowel in that second syllable. For the Utahns reading this, I know it sounds crazy to hear that that this is the most common way of saying this word, but it is standard American English pronunciation. You'll hear it in the news, on the radio, in movies, and in songs. 

For those with good ears though, you might have picked up on a slightly different way of saying *mountain*. Here's a recording of AUDIO.

What we have here is that same glottal stop that we had in the standard variant (<span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span>). But this time, instead of going stright to the *n* sound, there's still a vowel there. If we wanted to spell this out, it might be something like "<span style="color:#d95f02;">moun'in</span>". 

<span class="sidenote">In *Encanto*, Luisa says this variant in the song "Under the Surface" in the line "I move mountains, I move churches…". I don't think I've ever heard it in the media anywhere else.</span>As it turns out, this variant is somewhat common in Utah. Several studies have anaylzed it and have found that it occurs about 15% of the time. It's not unique to Utah, but it is more common there than in most other areas.

However, even though it's not particularly common, it's *very much* on the mind of Utahns. Ask any random Utahn about Utah English and odds are pretty good that they'll say something about *mountain*. As a grad student, I traveled to Utah to collect some audio and people said, "Oh, so you want me to say *mountain*, right?" 

In these comments, it's clear that this pronunciation is stigmatized. People make fun of it and think it's bad in some way. However, what's interesting to me is that the stigma is associated with not just this <span style="color:#d95f02;">moun'in</span> variant, but it's also associated with the General American standard, <span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span>. In fact, most of the participants for this study, when discussing *mountain*, mentioned <span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span> instead of <span style="color:#d95f02;">moun'in</span>. For example: INSERT AUDIO

So, what seems to be happening is that the stigma associated with the glottal stop in <span style="color:#d95f02;">moun'in</span> has spread to the glottal stop in <span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span>---even though that's how most people say it. I don't know if I've ever seen another case where the mainstream, General American pronunciation is stigmatized. For a linguistic nerd like me, this is super fascinating.

So, for people who don't like the glottal stop, what do they do? They say the *t* in *moutain* very clearly. I call this the *hyperarticulated* variant, <span style="color:#1b9e77;">mountain</span>. Here's an example of that: INSERT AUDIO

Based on people's comments, it seems like many Utahns are under the impression that *this* is how most North Americans say *mountain* most of the time. I don't know how else to say this… but that's not correct. Yes, it is true that most people say <span style="color:#1b9e77;">mountain</span> with a nice strong *t* sometimes, particularly when trying to speak clearly or if they're in a formal situation. But, most of the time, most North Americans say *mountain* as <span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span>. Here's a chart show the distribution of variants across three states:

Going back to Utah, the data shows that this hyperarticulated variant, <span style="color:#1b9e77;">mountain</span>, is the most common in Utah. It seems like the stigma associated with the glottal stop in the other two variants has gotten to people. In Idaho and Wyoming, you don't get this variant nearly as much; it seems like saying *mountain* with a nice clear *t* is a Utah thing. So, in a bit of irony, in an effort to avoid sounding like a Utahn (my saying <span style="color:#d95f02;">moun'in</span>), Utahns actually sound like Utahns (by overusing the hyperarticulated <span style="color:#1b9e77;">mountain</span>). Isn't that wild?



So, next time you hear someone talking about *mountain* in Utah, you can tell them that most people say <span style="color:#7570b3;">moun'n</span> and it's only in Utah that you get people saying that *t* in <span style="color:#1b9e77;">mountain</span> distinctly outside of formal contexts. 


## FALSE




## -ing

The most common way of pronouncing *ing* at the ends of words (as in *bowling*, *talking*, and *sitting*) is with that sort of *ng* sound said towards the back of the mouth. <span class="sidenote">Linguists call this sound a "velar nasal" and use the symbol [ŋ] to represent it.</span> It the result of an *n* and a *g* sound combining into one sound. 

Most people are aware of another way that *ing* is pronounced. People sometimes call it "*g*-dropping"<span class="sidenote">The term "*g*-dropping" is a bit of a misnomer because you're not actually dropping any sounds. You're just changing the single *ng* sound into a regular *n* sound.</span> and spell it with an apostrophe: "*huntin'*, *fishin'*, *swimmin'*. As you might expect, this variant was used some of the time. Of the 902 *ing* words, I heard this one in 82 (9.1%) of them. INSERT CLIP HERE.

You may think that the standard *ng* and the *g*-dropped version are the only ways that *ing* can be pronounced. It may surprise you then that I heard at least **five** pronunciations of *ing*. Intrigued? Read on.

### Adding a *g* or a *k*

A handful of people pronounced *ing* with either a *g* or a *k* sound at the end. When people mock this accent, they sometimes spell it as *talkingk*. What's going on is that the combined *ng* sound isn't fully combined, and the *g* is still pronounced very lightly. INSERT CLIP HERE. 

Other people pronounce that extra consonant at the end pretty strongly so it sounds like a full-on *k*. Here's a clip of a 25-year-old White woman from Nampa, Idaho saying the word *shelling* with this pronunciation.
<audio src="/audio/ID_WY_MT_UT/NG_k_PhonicID021-Hayley_shelling.mp3" controls preload></audio>

This pronunciation is not unique to the Rocky Mountains at all. It's quite common in England, around cities like Manchester and Liverpool. It's also heard in New York City and is sometimes made fun of in phrases like "Long Guy-land" (for "Long Island"). You occasionally hear it in other people scattered across the USA too, like the host in the [Apple News Today podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-news-today/id1473872585).

### EEN

Another way that *ing* is pronounced is sort of a mix of the standard *ng* and "*g*-dropping*. What's happening is you get the "ee" vowel in *ing* combined with the regular *n* in "*g*-dropping." It's as if the word *sailing* were pronounced as *salene* (that salty stuff used in hospitals). I call this one "een" because when people say it, it sounds like the word ends in *een* instead of *ing*.<span class="sidenote">There's actually not a lot of research into this variant.</span>

What surpsised me is that this was the second most common variant in my data. 98 (10.9%) of the words I listened to had it. INSERT CLIP HERE.

My Californian mother-in-law says this a lot and I heard it a lot in Washington too. So, is this something unique to the Rocky Mountains? It's probably not *exclusive* to the area, but my general impression is that it's more common than in other places. 

### Adding other sounds at the end

The last two variants I heard were ones that added other sounds at the end of the *ng*. The first one is where it sounds like there's an *h* sound. It's a little bit like the person exhales after saying the word. This was not particularly common, but I heard it 56 times (6.2%). What's interesting is that 20 different people said this at least once. One person even used this variant more than the standard! Here's a clip of her INSERT CLIP HERE.

The other one I heard is that sometimes people put almost a vowel-like sound at the end. Again, it wasn't very common, only showing up in 25 (2.5%) of the words I heard. But 10 people said it at least once, and one person used it more than the standard variant. Here's a clip of him INSERT CLIP HERE.
