Today I gave a talk that Betsy Sneller and I have been working on called "How Sample Size Impacts Pillai Scores â€“ and What Sociophoneticians Should Do About It" at the 50th New Ways of Analyzing Variation conference in San Jose! This is an update  to what we presented at [ASA2021](/blog/asa2021).

We have three things you can download. 

<div class="biglink"><a href="/downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pptx" title="NWAV50 slides" class="nodot">Download the<br />powerpoint here!</a></div>
1. First is the actual powerpoint file. In the notes of each slide though you can see the actual script I read, so you can read every word that was said during the talk.

<div class="biglink"><a href="/downloads/221014-NWAV50_pillai.pdf" title="PDF of NWAV50 slides" class="nodot">Download a PDF<br />of the slides here!</a></div>
2. Next, if that's too much for you, you can download just a PDF of the talk. In case you want this ligherweight version of the slides.

<div class="biglink"><a href="/downloads/221014-JASA_manuscript.pdf" title="NWAV49 poster" class="nodot">Download the<br />manuscript here!</a></div>
3. Finally, here is the current manuscript that is under review with the *Journal of the Acoustical Society of America*. The final product will likely change somewhat, but most of the information is there.

If you need to calculate Pillai scores in R, I've got a two-part tutorial for you ([here](/blog/a-tutorial-in-calculating-vowel-overlap) and [here](/blog/vowel-overlap-in-r-advanced-topics)). I also did a blog post ([here](/blog/pillai-scores-dont-change-after-normalization)) about how Pillai scores don't seem to change after normalization.
