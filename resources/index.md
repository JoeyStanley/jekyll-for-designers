## Resources

This page is mostly under construction still but will eventually be a central place for all things useful for other linguists. It'll eventually list software I've found useful and book recommendations, as well as links to resources I've developed and other helpful pages I write. For now, I can list a couple things. 

<h3><a href="/excel.html">Excel Workshop</a></h3>

I recently gave a workshop on Microsoft Excel in the main library at UGA. It was very well-attended and included graduate students and faculty from a variety of areas in the humanities and social sciences. I normally wouldn't link to just a blog post, but this one does do a good job at summarizing the main points and has the content available for download.
