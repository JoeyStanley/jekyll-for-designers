<h2>Western American English</h2>
<img src="images/projects/west.png" alt="Western US states">
<p>One of my areas of research is on English in the Western United States. Thanks to a grant from the UGA Graduate School, I've collected recordings from people all across the West using Using Amazon Mechanical Turk in order to get a better idea about what people sound like. I'm particularly interested in some of the states that get overlooked like Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. I'll also be targeting linguistic features that are known to be important in Western American English, but I've also included some other stuff based on my experiences in the West. This should be a fantastic project with several hundred participants scattered across a huge portion of the US. It's my hope that it will provide a really good look into this region that will jumpstart me into further research on specific areas.

<h2>Cowlitz County, Washington</h2>
<img src="images/projects/cowlitz.png" alt="Cowlitz County">
<p>My main research project within the West is in the Pacific Northwest. In 2016 I conducted 54 sociolinguistic interviews in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cowlitz+County,+WA/@46.1203776,-123.0089545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549415fb272f02b1:0x925df86af59a9d68!8m2!3d46.1746472!4d-122.7746902" title="Cowlitz County, Washington">Cowlitz County, Washington</a> and I’ve only scratched the surface in analyzing that data. I have recently given presentations about the <i>Mary-merry-marry</i> and the <i>pull-pole</i> mergers in this area and on clear generational changes in the pronunciation of words like <i>bag</i> as well as the /o/ sound. I also have access to the original handwritten data from the <em><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Linguistic+Atlas+of+the+Pacific+Northwest%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C11&amp;as_sdtp=">Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest</a></em>—which, as far as I know, hasn’t seen the light of day for several decades. I’m hoping to incorporate that into my work, though admittedly I haven't gotten too far yet.</p>

<h2>Utah English</h2>
<img src="images/projects/utah.jpg" alt="Utah">
<p>Another area I focus on in the West is Utah. I worked on a poster involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker (<a href="https://www.academia.edu/26986601/Phonetic_Shift_ɔr_Phonemic_Change_American_English_mergers_over_40_years">Stanley &amp; Renwick 2016</a>). Most recently, I've been working with Kyle Vanderniet on consonantal variation in Utah English. Utah is a unique place: its settlement history and highly concentrated Mormon population has had an impact on the English spoken in the region. I think it deserves some more attention by sociolinguists and dialectologists.</p>

<h2>Linguistic Atlas Project</h2>
<img src="images/projects/lap.jpg" alt="Linguistic Atlas Project Logo">
<p>My funding is through the <a href="http://www.lap.uga.edu/" title="Linguist Atlas Project">Linguistic Atlas Project</a> where I handle most of the coding and phonological processing of data. As part of a recent NSF grant, with Drs. <a href="https://www.english.uga.edu/directory/495/detail">Bill Kretzschmar</a> and <a href="https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about" title="Peggy Renwick">Peggy Renwick</a> as co-PIs, a handful of grad students and about three dozen undergrads are actively transcribing and processing a 64-speaker subset of the Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States (LAGS). This data has never been processed yet, and we're running into a lot of "fun" obstacles in dealing with very scratchy recordings of southern speakers from the 1970s. This is a very active project and we are going to a lot of conferences with preliminary work.</p>

<h2>English Pre-Lateral Vowels</h2>
<img src="images/projects/laterals.png" alt="spectrogram of wool">
<p>A lot of studies exclude vowels followed by coda laterals in their anaylsis because they kinda mess things up. Well, I'm curious about what actually happens to these vowels. There are some mergers going on in some places, like <i>feel</i>-<i>fill</i>, <i>fail</i>-<i>fell</i>, and <i>pool</i>-<i>pull</i>-<i>pole</i>. But a lot of people have some sort of marginal contrast between these infrequent vowel classes. I'm currently studying what this means, taking into account speakers' production and their own intuition about these words, in order to understand more about this often-overlooked area of English phonology.</p>

<h2>UGA DigiLab</h2>
<img src="images/projects/digi.jpg" alt="DigiLab Logo">
<p>I also work with the UGA <a href="https://digi.uga.edu" title="DigiLab main page">DigiLab</a> where I give seminars and workshops on how to help students and faculty use computers effectively in their humanities research. I also do one-on-one consultations. Though I'm not actively publishing in this field, I do produce a series of useful resources as a part of this work. I've presented in the DigiLab Colloquium series (<a href="https://digi.uga.edu/news/build-a-better-project-digi-colloquium-review/" class="link" target="_blank" title="link to digi.uga.edu"></a>
