# Research



This page highlights some of my research, organized thematically. I am a dialectologist, so several of my research interests are on specific regions. But intersecting these regions is where the sociolinguist in me comes out, and I try to uncover the meaning in linguistic variants---particularly the infrequent ones. And I go about these questions in these areas as a phonetician, analyzing speech production data and vowel trajectories. Finally, in nearly every study, I put on my quantitative linguist/data scientist/statistican cap when I actually do the analysis and interpretation. I think it's a great intersection of subdisciplines within linguistics and I'm kept on my toes trying to keep up with each field.

## Cowlitz County, Washington

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/cowlitz.png" alt="Cowlitz County">
In grad school, I did some fieldwork in [Cowlitz County, Washington](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cowlitz+County,+WA/@46.1203776,-123.0089545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549415fb272f02b1:0x925df86af59a9d68!8m2!3d46.1746472!4d-122.7746902), and since not a lot of research is done in the Pacific Northwest, I've been trying to document the English spoken there. In my dissertation, I showed that the younger people are shifting their front lax vowels like in other parts of the US and Canada. I've also done a couple spin-off studies on <sc>bag</sc>-raising, prelateral mergers, and prerhotic mergers. It's a fun area and look forward to uncovering more detail on southwest Washington!

## Utah English
<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/utah.jpg" alt="Utah">

Another area I focus on in the West is Utah. I worked on a <a href="/downloads/160714-LabPhon15-poster.pdf">poster</a> involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker. Most recently, I've been working with Kyle Vanderniet on consonantal variation in Utah English, as in the words <i>mountain</i> and <i>false</i> or in word-final <i>-ing</i>. I was also able to conduct additional fieldwork in Utah County but I'd really like to do some more. Utah is a unique place: its settlement history and highly concentrated Mormon population has had an impact on the English spoken in the region. I think it deserves some more attention by sociolinguists and dialectologists.

## The South

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/lap.svg" alt="Linguistic Atlas Project Logo">
Having firmly established myself as a researcher of Western American English, I was reluctant to start doing research on the South since the amount of existing literature is vast. But, as a research assistant for the Linguistic Atlas Project for four years, I couldn't help but begin analysis on DASS, a newly transcribed corpus of interviews from the 1970s and 1980s. Together with Peggy Renwick and the others at the Linguistic Atlas team, we've dug deep into the phonetics of how southerners sounded a couple generations ago. You can see and interact with some of this data by going a site I made called the <a href="http://lap3.libs.uga.edu/u/jstanley/vowelcharts/" title="GSV"><i>Gazetteer of Southern Vowels</i></a>.

## Vowel Formant Trajectories

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/trajectories.jpg">
Traditional sociophonetic reseach analyzes vowels using a pair of measurements, usually somewhere near the midpoint of the vowel. We can get a greater understanding of vowels by extracting data at multiple timepoints per vowel. In particular, I think there is important sociolinguistic meaning encoded in formant trajectories. Much of my recent research has gone this route, and has used generalized additive mixed-effects models to analyze the resulting data. This type of analysis yields complex results and visualizations, but I think we're starting to get a better idea of how vowels work while uncovering exciting new research questions and possibilities.

## Infrequent Phonological Variables

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/laterals.png" alt="spectrogram of wool">
I'm interested in phenomena on the margins of English phonology. There are some speech patterns that are quite infrequent because the particular sequence of sounds only exists in a handful of words. For example, I've found phonological and regional patterns in words with /ɛɡ/ (<i>beg</i>, <i>leg</i>). I've also found that people in Utah have a tap in /θɹ/ clusters (<i>three</i>, <i>throw</i>) but Washingtonians don't. Utahns also insert stops in /ls/ clusters (<i>false</i>, <i>salsa</i>). How infrequent can a variable be and still exhibit language-internal, regional, and sociolinguistic variability?

## "Mormonese"

<img class="research-img" style="width:10%; padding: 1em 5%;" src="images/projects/moroni.png">
Mormons, more properly referred to as members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, were once distinct enough to be considered an ethnic group. Today, their behavior, dress, and culture are much more mainstream, but their speech patterns might not always be. I'm curious about how Mormons talk, whether they're in Utah or not. I'm also curious about their speech in relation to non-Mormons and ex-Mormons. I'd also like to disentangle Mormonese from Utah English, because I think they're different. My new position at Brigham Young University will certainly give me access to this population and I hope to soon uncover some new findings on Mormonese.

## Western American English

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/mturk.jpg" alt="Western US states">
My interest in English in Washington and Utah extends to the entire Pacific Northwest and the Western states generally. Compared to some other regions, there's not a lot of research on how people talk in the West, particularly in the rural areas. I've collected some audio from across the West remotely using Amazon Mechanical Turk, but I'd really like to dig deeper in some of the overlooked areas like Idaho and Wyoming. I've lived in the West and I know there are really interesting speech patterns out there, and I'd like to document those.

## UGA DigiLab

<img class="research-img" src="images/projects/digi.jpg" alt="DigiLab Logo">
I also work with the UGA <a href="https://digi.uga.edu" title="DigiLab main page">DigiLab</a> where I give seminars and workshops on how to help students and faculty use computers effectively in their humanities research. Though I'm not actively publishing in this field, I do produce a series of useful resources as a part of this work. My biggest project was running weekly <a href = "pages/r-workshops">workshops on R</a> and over the summer I gave a <a href="/pages/bones_workshop">specialized seminar</a> to bioarcheology students. I've presented in the DigiLab Colloquium series, led a workshop on <a href="/excel">Excel</a>, and have given several workshops on how to increase your <a href="/brand-yourself">online presence</a>. Right now, I'm offering one-on-one digital humanities consultations.
