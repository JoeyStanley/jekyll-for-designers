## Courses

### [Phonetics and Phonology](http://bulletin.uga.edu/Link.aspx?cid=ling3060)

I taught this course Fall 2017 and Spring 2019 at UGA. [Here](/downloads/190308_LING3060_syllabus.pdf) is a syllabus.

**[Praat Tutorial](/downloads/190523-Praat_tutorial.pdf)**---For homework, I often assign students mini-projects that involve the use of Praat. This assignment serves as a useful tutorial to downloading and running Praat for the first time. In it, I give detailed instructions on how to make and transcribe a sentence.

**[Features Chart](/downloads/180814-features_chart.pdf)**---When I was preparing to teach features for the first time, I found it hard to keep track of all of them so I started making a chart. It turned out to be pretty useful and I thought my students might like it too. It's meant to act as reference rather than instruction, so you'll still have to read through the relevant chapters to understand everything. It's a lot of information to cram into a single page, so it's still a work in progress to make it look better. It's sort of one of those things that makes sense to the person who made it and no one else, so you're milage may vary. I should have an accompanying "How to use this chart" guide. Maybe next time. 

### [English Phonetics and Phonology](https://catalog.byu.edu/humanities/linguistics/english-phonetics-and-phonology)

I'm currently teaching this course for the first time. It's similar to the Phonetics and Phonology course I taught already, but it cuts out most non-English material and goes into more depth into English. [Here](/downloads/220103-E327_syllabus.pdf) is a syllabus.

### [Introduction to Sociolinguistics](https://catalog.byu.edu/humanities/linguistics/introduction-sociolinguistics)

I taught this course in Winter 2021. This is the undergraduate-level version of the course. You can look through the syllabus [here](/downloads/210102-L452_syllabus.pdf). We followed Allan Bell's *The Guidebook to Sociolinguistics* for the most part, though I threw in some additional topics towards the end.

### [Sociolinguistics](https://catalog.byu.edu/humanities/linguistics/sociolinguistics)

I taught this course in Winter 2021 and Fall 2021. This is the graduate-level version of the Introduction to Sociolinguistics course above (so it's still introductory course) and is similar to the undergraduate version except we take one day a week to read and discuss articles. [Here](/downloads/220103-L550_syllabus.pdf) is my most recent syllabus.

### [Introduction to Varieties of English](https://catalog.byu.edu/humanities/linguistics/introduction-varieties-of-english)

I've taught this course three times. In Summer 2020, it was completely online and had a focus on the British Isles to make up for the study abroad to the UK and Ireland that was cancelled due to covid. In Fall 2020 and Fall 2021 we covered 30 varieties of English in three broad units: North America, the British Isles, and everywhere else. [Here](/downloads/220103-E468_syllabus.pdf) is my syllabus from Fall 2021.

### [Linguistics Tools 1](https://catalog.byu.edu/humanities/linguistics/linguistic-tools-1)

I taught this course in Fall 2020 and Fall 2021. It covers how to conduct a linguistics study and covers software like Zotero, Word, Excel, Praat, AntConc, Qualtrics, and Jamovi with an introduction to statistics scattered throughout. [Here](/downloads/220103-L240_syllabus.pdf) is a syllabus from when I taught it in Fall 2021.

### [Research Design in Linguistics](https://gradstudies.byu.edu/course/research-design-linguistics)

I team-taught this course in Winter 2021 with Dan Dewey and I'm currently flying solo this semester. Students end the semester with a prospectus for their MA thesis and walk away with some introductory statistics. [Here](/downloads/220103-L604_syllabus.pdf) is my current syllabus.

## Workshops

### [LaTeX Workshops](/pages/latex)

Caleb Crumley, Jonathan Crum, and I led a series of three workshops on LaTeX as a way to introduce the new UGA Dissertation LaTeX template. I discussed basic LaTeX skills, Caleb showed how to use the template, and Jonathan illustrated more advanced topics. This series got the stamp of approval from the UGA Graduate School and had over 100 registered attendees.

### [Praat Scripting Workshops](/pages/praat-workshops)

Lisa Lipani and I led three workshops on Praat and Praat scripting. We discussed the basics of the Praat interface, how to code basic things, and then did one devoted to automatic extraction of formant measurements. 

### [Data Visualization Workshops](/pages/dataviz)

In a suite of five workshops, I discussed data visualization. Three of them were focused on ggplot2 (see the R workshops) but two were platform-independent and discussed the use of color and Edward Tufte's principles of data visualization. Though they're outside my discipline, I really enjoyed these workshops.

### [R Workshops](/pages/r-workshops)

I have led more than a dozen workshops on R on a variety of topics. In addition to just an intro to R, I've talked about the tidyverse, RMarkdown, and Shiny. I've done a handful just on ggplot2, and I have handouts ready for more detailed workshops on customizing plots in ggplot2 for future workshops. 

### [Professionalization ("Brand Yourself") Workshops](/pages/brand-yourself)

In this workshops, I discuss ways to boost your online presence as an academic. I've given this workshop several times over the past few years and it has evolved quite a bit based on my own experiences. The gist: make a website and possibly also get active on Twitter.

### [Academic Poster Workshop](/downloads/190911-poster_workshop.pdf)

I gave a brief---and very opinionated---workshop on how to make an academic poster. I discuss overall design and layout, nit-picky things like font sizes and color, and content. 

### [Excel Workshop](/blog/excel-workshop)

I once gave a workshop on Excel. It was a while ago.
