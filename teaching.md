Teaching
========

<br/>

## [LING 3060: Phonetics and Phonology](http://bulletin.uga.edu/Link.aspx?cid=ling3060)

I thought this course Fall semester of 2017. You can find the syllabus [here](/downloads/171106_LING3060_syllabus.pdf).

I'll also teach this course Spring of 2019.

### [Features Chart](/downloads/180814-features_chart.pdf)
When I was preparing to teach features for the first time, I found it hard to keep track of all of them so I started making a chart. It turned out to be pretty useful and I thought my students might like it too. It's meant to act as reference rather than instruction, so you'll still have to read through the relevant chapters to understand everything. It's a lot of information to cram into a single page, so it's still a work in progress to make it look better. It's sort of one of those things that makes sense to the person who made it and no one else, so you're milage may vary. I should have an accompanying "How to use this chart" guide. Maybe next time.
