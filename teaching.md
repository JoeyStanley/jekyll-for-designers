## Courses

### [LING 3060: Phonetics and Phonology](http://bulletin.uga.edu/Link.aspx?cid=ling3060)

I taught this course Fall 2017 and Spring 2019. You can find a recent syllabus [here](/downloads/190308_LING3060_syllabus.pdf).

**[Praat Tutorial](/downloads/190523-Praat_tutorial.pdf)**---For homework, I often assign students mini-projects that involve the use of Praat. This assignment serves as a useful tutorial to downloading and running Praat for the first time. In it, I give detailed instructions on how to make and transcribe a sentence.

**[Features Chart](/downloads/180814-features_chart.pdf)**---When I was preparing to teach features for the first time, I found it hard to keep track of all of them so I started making a chart. It turned out to be pretty useful and I thought my students might like it too. It's meant to act as reference rather than instruction, so you'll still have to read through the relevant chapters to understand everything. It's a lot of information to cram into a single page, so it's still a work in progress to make it look better. It's sort of one of those things that makes sense to the person who made it and no one else, so you're milage may vary. I should have an accompanying "How to use this chart" guide. Maybe next time.

## Workshops

### [LaTeX Workshops](/pages/latex)

Caleb Crumley, Jonathan Crum, and I led a series of three workshops on LaTeX as a way to introduce the new UGA Dissertation LaTeX template. I discussed basic LaTeX skills, Caleb showed how to use the template, and Jonathan illustrated more advanced topics. This series got the stamp of approval from the UGA Graduate School and had over 100 registered attendees.

### [Praat Scripting Workshops](/pages/praat-workshops)

Lisa Lipani and I led three workshops on Praat and Praat scripting. We discussed the basics of the Praat interface, how to code basic things, and then did one devoted to automatic extraction of formant measurements. 

### [Data Visualization Workshops](/pages/dataviz)

In a suite of five workshops, I discussed data visualization. Three of them were focused on ggplot2 (see the R workshops) but two were platform-independent and discussed the use of color and Edward Tufte's principles of data visualization. Though they're outside my discipline, I really enjoyed these workshops.

### [R Workshops](/pages/r-workshops)

I have led more than a dozen workshops on R on a variety of topics. In addition to just an intro to R, I've talked about the tidyverse, RMarkdown, and Shiny. I've done a handful just on ggplot2, and I have handouts ready for more detailed workshops on customizing plots in ggplot2 for future workshops. 

### [Professionalization ("Brand Yourself") Workshops](/pages/brand-yourself)

In this workshops, I discuss ways to boost your online presence as an academic. I've given this workshop several times over the past few years and it has evolved quite a bit based on my own experiences. The gist: make a website and possibly also get active on Twitter.

### [Academic Poster Workshop](/downloads/190911-poster_workshop.pdf)

I gave a brief---and very opinionated---workshop on how to make an academic poster. I discuss overall design and layout, nitpicky things like font sizes and color, and content. 

### [Excel Workshop](/blog/excel-workshop)

I once gave a workshop on Excel. It was a while ago.
