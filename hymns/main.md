# Overview

This portion of my website describes a project I did on the hymns of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<sup>1</sup>. My goal was to find out which hymns were the most and least commonly sung in Sacrament Meetings. So a few years ago I put together a project to collect a bunch of data to answer these questions.

## How am I doing this?

In pretty much every ward, *someone* has a document or spreadsheet on their computer that keeps track of what hymns have been sung in that ward for at least the past year. I want to track down as many of these people as I can and ask them to send me what hymns their ward has been singing. With many thousands of hymns from many wards, I'd be able to piece together some information about why we pick the hymns we do. You can read more about how I collect and process this data on the [Methods](/hymns/methods.html) page. 

## How much data do I have?

My goal was to get roughly a year's worth of hymns from about 300 wards across the US and Canada. That would be roughly 40,000--55,000 actual data points I could then use for analysis. This was perhaps a little ambitious. I did end up with about 20 wards and over 6,000 individual data points. You can track my progress [here](/hymns/progress.html). 

## Results

So, what is the most common hymn? According to my data, it's *I Stand All Amazed.* What about the most common non-sacrament hymn? *I Know that My Redeemer Lives*. Click on the [Findings](/hymns/findings.html) tab to learn more about what I've discovered.

## You can help too!

You can help with this project! Maybe you know someone who has your ward's hymns on a spreadsheet somewhere or maybe you do yourself. Click [here](/hymns/contribute) to find out how you can contribute.

## Why bother?

I started this project in 2014 when I had a bit more spare time and I was just starting to learn about statistics and working with spreadsheets of data. I haven't had much time to work on it in the past few years, and with the announcement of a new hymnal sometime soon, it'll be obsolete anyway. Regardless, I thought I'd put together this website to share my findings in case there are others that are curious.
