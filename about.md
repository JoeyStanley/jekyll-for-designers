Hey. I'm Joey. I'm a third-year lingusitics grad student at the University of Georgia, doing a lot of sociolinguistics and phonetics while finding new statistical and computational methods to help me in my research.

I work at with the [Linguistic Atlas Project](http://lap.uga.edu/ "Linguist Atlas Project"), where I write and maintain most of the Praat scripts, under the direction of Drs. [Bill Kretzschmar](https://www.english.uga.edu/directory/495/detail) and [Peggy Renwick](https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about "Peggy Renwick"). I also work with the UGA [DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu "DigiLab main page") where I give seminars and workshops on how to help students and faculty use computers effectively in their humanities research. On top of that, I work with Dr. Renwick in developing teaching materals for her *Quantitative Methods in Linguistics* course here at UGA. 

My own research is currently on vowels in the western United States. Dr. Renwick presented a poster she and I worked on involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker ([Stanley & Renwick 2016](https://www.academia.edu/26986601/Phonetic_Shift_ɔr_Phonemic_Change_American_English_mergers_over_40_years)), and currently, with data from [Ben Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/) at the University of Alberta, we are digging a little deeper into that. I've also got a big project in the works on English in the Pacific Northwest. I conducted 54 sociolinguistic interviews this summer in [Cowlitz County, Washington](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cowlitz+County,+WA/@46.1203776,-123.0089545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549415fb272f02b1:0x925df86af59a9d68!8m2!3d46.1746472!4d-122.7746902 "Cowlitz County, Washington") and I've only scratched the surface in analyzing that data. (See my upcoming presentation at the [2017 Annual Meeting of the America Dialect Society](http://www.americandialect.org/american-dialect-society-2017-annual-meeting-schedule) for my first results!) I also have access to the original handwritten data from the *[Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22Linguistic+Atlas+of+the+Pacific+Northwest%22&btnG=&as_sdt=1%2C11&as_sdtp=)*—which, as far as I know, haven't seen the light of day for several decades—and I'm hoping to incorporate that into my work.

I publish under the more grown-up-sounding version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey.
