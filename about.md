Hey. I'm Joey. I'm a third-year lingusitics grad student at the University of Georgia, doing a lot of sociolinguistics and phonetics. 

I work at with the [Linguistic Atlas Project](http://lap.uga.edu/ "Linguist Atlas Project"), where I write and maintin most of the Praat scripts. I also work with the [DigiLab](https://digi.uga.edu "DigiLab main page") where I give seminars and workshops on how to help students and faculty use computers effectively in their research. I also work closely with [Dr. Peggy Renwick](https://faculty.franklin.uga.edu/mrenwick/about "Peggy Renwick") in developing teaching materals for her Quantitative Methods in Linguistics course here at UGA. 

My own research is currently on vowels in the western United States. Dr. Renwick presented a poster she and I worked on involving vowel mergers over time in a single speaker ([Stanley & Renwick 2016](https://www.academia.edu/26986601/Phonetic_Shift_ɔr_Phonemic_Change_American_English_mergers_over_40_years)), and currently, in collaboration with data from [Ben Tucker](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~bvtucker/) at the University of Alberta, we are digging a little deeper in that. I'm also in the middle of a large project on English in the Pacific Northwest. I conducted 54 sociolinguistic interviews this summer in [Cowlitz County, Washington](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cowlitz+County,+WA/@46.1203776,-123.0089545,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x549415fb272f02b1:0x925df86af59a9d68!8m2!3d46.1746472!4d-122.7746902 "Cowlitz County, Washington") and I've only scratched the surface in analyzing that data. (See my upcoming presentation at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the America Dialect Society for my first results!) I also have access to the original handwritten data from the Linguistic Atlas of the Pacific Northwest—which, as far as I know, haven't seen the light of day for several decades—and I'm hoping to incorporate that into my work.

I publish under the more official version of my name, Joseph A. Stanley, but anyone who has ever met me knows I go by Joey.
